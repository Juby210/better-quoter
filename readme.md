# BetterQuoter
The real better quoter for discord. Allows you to quote multiple messages & users at same time across channels or servers or just customize quote format.

Note: this plugin is not finished, due to lack of time it will only receive important fixes.

#### TODO
- [ ] Quote full message group (by eg shift + quote button)
- [ ] Possibility to set more formats than one
- [ ] Option to customize variables (for eg custom time format)
- [x] Preview before sending message
- [x] Option to replace @ in mentions
- [x] Quote only selected text
- [x] Setting to use QuoteContainer also from context menu button
